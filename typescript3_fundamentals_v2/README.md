## What's TypeScript

* An open-sourced typed, syntactic superset of JavaScript, developed by Microsoft.
* Compiles to readable JavaScript.
* Comes in three parts: Language, Language Server, and Compiler
* Works seamlessly with Babel 7.


## Why add types

* Encode constraints and assumptions, as part of developer intent.
* Catch common mistakes (i.e. incomplete refactors)
* Move some runtime errors to compile time.
* Provide your consumers (including you) with a great DX.
