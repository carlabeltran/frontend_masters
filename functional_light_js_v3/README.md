* Imperative vs Declarative
  * Imperative code means code that is focused primarily on how to do something.
  * Declarative code - the how is not the important part. The important part is the what/the outcome and even more important than that, the why.
  * Your code comment should not duplicate the narrative of what the code is doing.
  * Your code comment should focus on the why, not the what, and sometimes should focus on the how if the code is confusing/hard to understand.
