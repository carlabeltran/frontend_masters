* Compiler
  * Something that turns a higher-level language into a lower-level language*.
* Souce code is meant to be human readable.
* The Stages of a Compiler
  * Parsing - take the source code and turn it into a representation of that code.
  * Transformation - Take that source code and transforms it to do whatever the compiler wants it to do.
  * Generation - Takes the transformed representation and turns it into a new string of code.
