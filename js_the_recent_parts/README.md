* Infinite number of ways to write the same program.
* The program is just a suggestion to the computer.
* primary purpose: code is for communicating ideas with other people.
* Code that you do not understand is cod that you cannot trust and code that you cannot trust is code that you do not understand.
* As much as 70% of our time spent coding is actually spent reading the code.
* Code must first be read before it can be written.
* The only way to ensure your code survives is to make sure it's readable.
* Warning: if your code has to be rewritten to be fixed, improved, or extended, you failed.
* 10% - 6 minutes out of each hour.
* Documentation and tests are important, but ultimately they're indirectly related to code quality.
* Readability directly impacts your ability, and that of everyone else, to do their job.
